<H1><li>WHAT ARE OUR COACHING CENTER BENIFTS?
<ul>
<H2><p><li><b>Better Results & Studentsâ€™ Learning Outcomes</b></p></li>
<p><li>No matter how prominent the organizational structure of the institute is, it will be rendered useless if it does not help the student to do well in their studies.</li></p>
<li>You must have come across many such students who often are in distress because they can not keep up with the pace of the rest of the class.</li>
<p><li>The parents of the students who spend an insurmountable amount in terms of semester fees; and then again they have to pay the tuition fees.
They are utterly disappointed when they discover that their children have failed a test or did not qualify in the final examination.</li><p>
<p><li>One of the best things about taking your coaching center online is that each session would have a limited number of students.
This will enable the trainer to focus on each student individually providing them with better instruction, 
while through online assessments the trainer can also determine the level of the student.</li></p></H2>
<H3><li>MANY QUESTION WILL COME TO YOUR MIND LIKE IS ONLINE EDUCATION GOOD FOR MY CHILD? WILL ONLINE EDUCATION HAVE SOME ACTUAL USEFUL CHANGES IN THE CHILD? ETC!ETC?/</li></H3>
<H4><li>Answer is yes, while doing our online course many of the children will have <b><u>behaviour fixed</u></b> as many parents suffer from that and also you will see many <b><u>improvments in their concentration in studies</u></b> and activities like <b><u>dancing, singing, painting, instruments</u></b> these are also things that we offer to grow your child's passion and hobbies.There are many <b><u>yoga classes happening everyday at the time you are suitable with</u></b>.
In many online courses you will see there are ton of students ,thats why teacher cannot focus on students individually ,but in <b>our premium there literally 5 to 10 students only and by buying  premium you can also have individual classes</b> ,and that's what we recommend your child to give it a try.
There is also our own app called <b><u>ICI classrrom no like other platforms this is divided ,so that according to your child class for an eg: if your child is in between 6th to 8th class theres an app called "ICI kids"</u></b>, if your child is from 9th to 12th class there  an app called <b><u>"ICI seniors"</u></b>and if your child is doing <b><u>JEE, IIT, CA etc there are different app for different courses.</u></b>
We promise that our teachers will make your student able for anything he is planning to do in future.
THERE are many <b><u>internship and job opportunities that will be offered to your child.</u></b></li></H4>
